# H-RANSAC
An implementation of RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus), H-RANSAC, implementing two logical geometrical tests (one ad-hoc and one post-hoc) on each iteration. The necessary iterations of the algorithm are calculated and homography matrix, H, is estimated.
Code is provided both in Python and in MATLAB.
